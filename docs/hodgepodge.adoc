Storages
--------

At the moment +hodgepodge+ supports local and session storage.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   session-storage]])
----

Low-level API
-------------

+hodgepodge+ has an API that mimics that of web storage, which can be used for writing and reading raw strings.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   get-item
                                   set-item
                                   remove-item
                                   clear!
                                   length]])

(clear! local-storage)

(length local-storage)
;; => 0

(set-item local-storage "foo" "bar")
(length local-storage)
;; => 1

(get-item local-storage "foo")
;; => "bar"

(remove-item local-storage "foo")
(length local-storage)
;; => 0
----

+get-item+ also supports passing a default argument to return when the given key is missing.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   get-item
                                   set-item
                                   clear!]])

(clear! local-storage)

(get-item local-storage "foo" 42)
;; => 42

(set-item local-storage "foo" "bar")

(get-item local-storage "foo" 42)
;; => "bar"
----


Transient storage
-----------------

Besides the low-level, raw-string API storages implement several ClojureScript core protocols.

They can be treated as an +ITransientAssociative+, thus supporting +assoc!+.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage]])

(def val {:bar 42 :timestamp (js/Date.)})
(assoc! local-storage :foo val)
(assert (= val (get local-storage :foo)))

(assoc! local-storage val :foo)
(assert (= :foo (get local-storage val)))
