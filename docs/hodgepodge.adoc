A idiomatic ClojureScript interface to HTML5 Storage.

Rationale
---------

This library is intended as a thin wrapper around the browser's storage API for making
it more Clojurey. Furthermore, it extends the Storage type for treating storage like
a transient map for storing and retrieving ClojureScript data structures.

Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The storage-atom library provides an atom backed by local or session storage: https://github.com/alandipert/storage-atom

Installation
------------

Leiningen
~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to use +hodgepodge+ in a Clojure project is by including
it as a dependency in your *_project.clj_*:

[source,clojure]
----
[hodgepodge "0.1-SNAPSHOT"]
----


Maven
~~~~~

Also, you can use it with Maven. First, add the Clojars repository:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
    <id>clojars.org</id>
    <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
----

Then for +hodgepodge+:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>hodgepodge</groupId>
    <artifactId>hodgepodge</artifactId>
    <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

Storages
--------

At the moment +hodgepodge+ supports local and session storage.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   session-storage]])
----

Low-level API
-------------

+hodgepodge+ has an API that mimics that of web storage, which can be used for writing and reading raw strings.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   get-item
                                   set-item
                                   remove-item
                                   clear!
                                   length]])

(clear! local-storage)

(length local-storage)
;; => 0

(set-item local-storage "foo" "bar")
(length local-storage)
;; => 1

(get-item local-storage "foo")
;; => "bar"

(remove-item local-storage "foo")
(length local-storage)
;; => 0
----

+get-item+ also supports passing a default argument to return when the given key is missing.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   get-item
                                   set-item
                                   clear!]])

(clear! local-storage)

(get-item local-storage "foo" 42)
;; => 42

(set-item local-storage "foo" "bar")

(get-item local-storage "foo" 42)
;; => "bar"
----


Transient storage
-----------------

Besides the low-level, raw-string API, storages implement several ClojureScript core protocols. The keys and values
that are inserted in the storage are serialized with +pr-str+ and deserialized with the reader.

Storages can be treated as an +ITransientAssociative+ and +ITransientMap+, thus supporting +assoc!+ and +dissoc!+. They
also implement +ICounted+ so you can use +count+ on them.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage clear!]])

(clear! local-storage)
(def val {:bar 42 :timestamp (js/Date.)})
(assoc! local-storage :foo val)
(count local-storage)
;; => 1

(dissoc! local-storage :foo)
(count local-storage)
;; => 0
----

The implementation of the +ILookup+ protocol let's us extract values from the storage.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage clear!]])

(clear! local-storage)
(assoc! local-storage :foo {:bar 42})
(get local-storage :foo)
;; => {:bar 42}

(dissoc! local-storage :foo)
(count local-storage)
(get local-storage :foo :missing)
;; => :missing
