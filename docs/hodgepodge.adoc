A idiomatic ClojureScript interface to HTML5 Storage.

Rationale
---------

This library is intended as a thin wrapper around the browser's storage API for making
it more Clojurey. Furthermore, it extends the Storage type for treating storage like
a transient map for inserting and retrieving ClojureScript data structures.

The serialization is done via `pr-str` and it uses the reader for deserializing strings
into ClojureScript or JavaScript data structures.

Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- +storage-atom+ provides an atom backed by local or session storage: https://github.com/alandipert/storage-atom
- +plato+ incrementally persist atom state to local storage:  https://github.com/eneroth/plato

Installation
------------

Leiningen
~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to use +hodgepodge+ in a Clojure project is by including
it as a dependency in your *_project.clj_*:

[source,clojure]
----
[hodgepodge "0.1.0"]
----


Maven
~~~~~

Also, you can use it with Maven. First, add the Clojars repository:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
    <id>clojars.org</id>
    <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
----

Then for +hodgepodge+:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>hodgepodge</groupId>
    <artifactId>hodgepodge</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Storages
--------

At the moment +hodgepodge+ supports local and session storage.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   session-storage]])
----

Low-level API
-------------

+hodgepodge+ has an API that mimics that of web storage, which can be used for writing and reading raw strings.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   get-item
                                   set-item
                                   remove-item
                                   clear!
                                   length]])

(clear! local-storage)

(length local-storage)
;; => 0

(set-item local-storage "foo" "bar")
(length local-storage)
;; => 1

(get-item local-storage "foo")
;; => "bar"

(remove-item local-storage "foo")
(length local-storage)
;; => 0
----

+get-item+ also supports passing a default argument to return when the given key is missing.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage
                                   get-item
                                   set-item
                                   clear!]])

(clear! local-storage)

(get-item local-storage "foo" 42)
;; => 42

(set-item local-storage "foo" "bar")

(get-item local-storage "foo" 42)
;; => "bar"
----


Transient storage
-----------------

Besides the low-level, raw-string API, storages implement several ClojureScript core protocols. The keys and values
that are inserted in the storage are serialized with +pr-str+ and deserialized with the reader.

Storages can be treated as an +ITransientAssociative+ and +ITransientMap+, thus supporting +assoc!+ and +dissoc!+. They
also implement +ICounted+ so you can use +count+ on them.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage clear!]])

(clear! local-storage)
(def val {:bar 42 :timestamp (js/Date.)})
(assoc! local-storage :foo val)
(count local-storage)
;; => 1

(dissoc! local-storage :foo)
(count local-storage)
;; => 0
----

The implementation of the +ILookup+ protocol let's us extract values from the storage.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :refer [local-storage clear!]])

(clear! local-storage)
(assoc! local-storage :foo {:bar 42})
(:foo local-storage)
;; => {:bar 42}

(dissoc! local-storage :foo)
(count local-storage)
(get local-storage :foo :missing)
;; => :missing
----

Storing and retrieving custom data types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since storage serialization is done with `pr-str`, we can make a custom type serializable
implementing the `cljs.core/IPrintWithWriter` protocol and making it output a tagged literal.

For a contrived example, let's implement a `Action` type which is of a ceratin kind and
has a payload associated with it.

[source,Clojure]
----
(deftype Action [kind payload]
  IEquiv
  (-equiv [_ other]
    (and (instance? Action other)
         (= kind (.-kind other))
         (= payload (.-payload other)))))
----

First, we are going to make its representation a tagged literal.
[source,Clojure]
----
(extend-type Action
  IPrintWithWriter
  (-pr-writer [a writer _]
    (-write writer (str "#action \""
                         (pr-str {:kind (.-kind a)
                                  :payload (.-payload a)})
                         "\""))))

(enable-console-print!)
(print (Action. :write-code {:language :clojurescript}))
; #action "{:kind :write-code, :payload {:language :clojurescript}}"
----

Now that our type is serializable we can make it deserializable by writing a function
that is able to read its literals and create an instance of `Action`. After doing this
we will extend the reader to be able to read our custom type's tagged literals.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[cljs.reader :as reader])

(defn read-action
  [a]
  (let [values (reader/read-string a)]
    (Action. (:kind values) (:payload values))))

(reader/register-tag-parser! "action" read-action)
----

Now we're able to store and retrieve actions from storages and to use them as keys.

[source,Clojure]
----
(require '[hodgepodge.core :as h])

(def a (Action. :write-code {:language :clojure}))

(assoc! h/local-storage :action a)
(assert (= a (:action h/local-storage)))

(assoc! h/local-storage a :action)
(assert (= :action (get h/local-storage a)))
